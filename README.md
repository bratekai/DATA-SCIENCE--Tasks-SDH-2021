Code should be commented and when it comes to the visualisation task you have to send visualisation in whatever form you think is best to present the insights of the data (PowerPoint presentation, Power Bi / Tableau dashboard, dashboards created manually, or loose images)
- If you have any questions regarding the organisation of the event, please write to https://www.facebook.com/Studentsdatahack-102825025233118 in private message
- You have to do tasks that you chose in the Google Form, and solve them individually
- Datasets with prefix "Wiz" are designed for visualisation task, datasets with prefix "Predykcyjne" for predictive task.
